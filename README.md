#Early detection of 3D printing issues
##Build a ML model to predict if there are any issues with the 3D print job based on close-up pictures taken by nozzle camera

###Community Prediction Competition

3D printing is an innovative way to fabricate parts from any 3D geometry model. However, 3D printing is also known to be prone errors. Most of these errors are visible via a close-up camera mounted right near the printer nozzle.

The goal of this competition is to predict 1 specific kind of error - under extrusion.
